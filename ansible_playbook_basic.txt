#ansible-playbook -i hosts zabix_api.yml --sudo 

ansible-playbook -i hosts copy_psexec.yml -t copy_psexec


1. First i have to create an playbook where i could include a hosts and role
 
		- hosts: win_servers

		  vars_files:
		      - zabbix/vars/main.yml
		      - zabbix/vars/{{ env_name }}.yml  [if you add another vars in vars files then you have to include it]
		  roles:
    
	            - zabbix-agent

2. Now i have to make an hosts files where [win_servers] will be included
	[win_servers]
	v0672a.vstage.co

	v0673a.vstage.co

	v0674a.vstage.co

3. Now you have to make role which role you included at primary playbook. Above we made role named 
	zabbix-agent so we need to create a folder named as same

4. In zabbix-agent folder I need to make 4 folders name (tasks, templates, files, vars)

	In task folder you can create main.yml to describe your task or you can make another task
	in different name and after that include that task to main.yml file

5. If any hard files are need to copy to servers then you need to keep those files in that folder.

6. In templates folder you can keep those files which is dynamic means in files you need to apply variables and you can change that variables at your will.

7. Lastly, the vars files where you have to mention those vars which are assigned at your task. when you execute that task then the task will include that variables.
